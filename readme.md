# DigitiNexus 3D Scene


A 3D-rendered interactive scene representing a creative workspace — featuring a Apple-inspired computer displaying the **os.digitinexus.com** system.  
This project combines 3D design, modern web rendering, and immersive storytelling to introduce **DigitiNexus**, a design-driven web agency.

## 🎨 Overview

The **DigitiNexus 3D Desk** is a visual and conceptual entry point to the DigitiNexus experience.  
It simulates a minimalist digital workspace rendered in 3D, where a computer on the desk runs a custom operating system — [os.digitinexus.com](https://os.digitinexus.com) — developed as part of a separate DigitiNexus project.

The scene is fully interactive:  
users can move the camera, toggle sound, and explore the environment as if stepping into a creative studio.
